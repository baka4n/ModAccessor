# ModAccessor

A simple gradle plugin to solve the problem of accessing private fields and methods during compile time.

**You should transform the classes in runtime by yourself.**

## Usage
```groovy
modAccessor {
    createTransformConfiguration(configurations.implementation)
    accessTransformerFiles = project.files('src/main/resources/META-INF/accesstransformer.cfg')
}

dependencies {
    accessImplementation(("com.simibubi.create:create-${minecraft_version}:6.0.4-61:slim"))
}
```
